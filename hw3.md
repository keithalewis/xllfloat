# Homework 3

Commit all your work then pull https://github.com/keithalewis/xllfloat.git.  
From Team Explorer Home click on Branchss and select the `hw3` branch.

Review the implementation of fms::root1d::bisect.  
Look for !!! in fmsroot1d.h and hw3.cpp for instructions on what code to write.  
Add formulas in hw3.xls to find roots using the False Position method.  
Use the formulas for Bisect as a guide.  
Make sure you add enough rows so all three kahan functions converge to a root.  
You can enter the functions in the cell called `function`.  

Ignore the error message when you open hw3.xlsx.  
It is an artifact of using dynamic ranges for the chart data.
